why did this happen?

the world is now very, very small and our individual actions make a huge impact on each other

america - and the world generally - can no longer afford to ignore the lessons other nations have demonstrated convincingly. we can no longer ignore science, or paint false narratives, and hope to survive
it's not about politics, it's about life going on and going on in a way that brings joy to as many as possible as often as possible. otherwise, why even be here?

the problem isn't that we have people we truly value and want to lift up as success stories, like Bill Gates or Kobe Bryant
the problem is that we have a system that allows legacy to prop up nepotism. there is nothing wrong in a world of abundance of gathering as much as possible for you and yours and to keep generations in that abundance, but in a world of scarcity - something the asian and european nations know far better than us americans - the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one (yea, I went Spock there)
we're already being forced by mother nature to make drastic changes in the way we live. it's only right and proper we consider all possibilities for crafting success
one change is that we need a system that values the right metrics of success, not the wrong metrics for promoting effective leadership and vision, that encourages division and bigotry
we should all be able to admit freely that the economy itself is an engineered thing. so is government. so is culture. so is art, history. these are all expressions of things we've learned, seen, experienced, changed. so are we, as individuals
and an engineered thing is a thing which can be helped to function better, to provide better results, to address the concerns of all while balancing the relative interests and rewards
but we have to work for it. it isn't free. and it isn't easy. and we won't be perfect. none of us is perfect. we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. we need to learn to grieve, to accept. to grow, to forgive
if you hate republicans, you need to understand that your hatred is an engine of instability
if you hate democrats, you need to understand that your hatred is an engine of instability
if you hate any group of people - without having walked every step in their shoes I might add - you need to understand that your hatred is an engine of instability
hatred didn't make this virus. it's scary in fact because of how little this virus regards us. we are suddenly no longer top dog in our domain.
but hatred and division created this mess. and if we don't learn our lesson now, we will never grow enough to face our next challenge.
we want to explore the stars, but we won't explore our cities or our rural communities, or other nations.
we want to save the world, but we want everything to be free and abundant.
that is not reality. that is a childish thing we must do away with. if we want to make that next leap - that big one we've all wondered about - into space, we better get this right 
as a species, we've been living in an adolescent phase globally. after all, we really haven't been "adulting" here on earth, have well?
all dreams of a bright future, here on earth or in space or inside of the mind, they all start with learning to accept reality, to accept that it's still really scary out there and we aren't always safe. but that's okay. we're not very safe things to be around ourselves, are we?


maybe it's true that humans only act when shocked into action - well, then now is the time to act as we have surely been shocked into action. let's sieze this chance to not throw away the past, ours or the rich history of nations' like china, india, japan, the koreas (both), russia. we all as a species have something to add, and something to learn 
so let's learn.
we as a society, as a nation, are not the best at everything. and politicians are not the right arbiters of expertise in each domain

the constitution was a living document meant to be upgraded, not iron clad. it was written to be adapted to the needs of our time

everyone has marveled at how fast china and south korea, among others, were able to marshall resources to bear to save lives - potentially millions of lives

but we can do that too. it's built into the bedrock of our institutions. I don't even mean waiting for a constitutional amendment, or a constitutional convention, I mean the right of self-governance

we do not need to wait to contribute. we need to build systems that effectively enable cooperation, monitor threats, protect as many as we can, reward good works - especially the small and forgotten works, like teachers

we can start that system right now. today. and you can help. you know what's cooler than a billion users? all of humanity, connected, empowered, enriched, encouraged, contributing, helping, not alone, not scared

help me build that brighter tomorrow. we don't need spaceships, AI or geoengineering right this second - we need to organize and execute better. we need distributed, decentralized, redundant, open, transparent community governance, scoped to each individual's greatest talents

there's a fear that China is building a black mirror surveillance state. well, right now they're using that surveillance apparatus to save lives, as is Israel. and I'm sure, so is the NSA. so let's not hate the tool, let's find a safe way to democratize the tool and turn it into one of personal and community empowerment, and accountability, with the chance of redemption

if there's one thing the internet has robbed us of at times is our shared sense of dignity and humanity. it has replaced it with something gaudy, unreal, plastic while impoverishing those it addicts.

but it doesn't HAVE to. it can be a wonderful tool of empathy and cooperation, if we build the right systems to provide that to anyone, no matter where they are, what language they speak, what religion they follow

if you want a star trek future, we need to be a star trek people. and that means growing up, learning to trust, learning to forgive, learning to accept what is human, and to not accept that which dehumanizes us

let's stop dreaming, or waiting for permission. let's just do it. let's build that future, from the ground up. the very first startup any human has ever constructed is a family. then a tribe, a society, maybe a church, maybe a city or a nation, or culture. but it starts from that first brick laid after the storm has passed.

we rebuild, and we learn

an engineering approach

east meets west
